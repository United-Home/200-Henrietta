Organizing a five-layer fridge effectively is all about temperature zones. The bottom is usually the coldest, while the top and the doors are the warmest.
Since your fourth layer is for vegetables and your fifth is for meat, here is a breakdown of where to put everything else to keep it fresh and safe.

### Where to put overflow vegetables?
If your vegetable drawer (4th layer) is full, the best place for extra vegetables is the shelf directly above it (the 3rd layer).
 * Why: This area is still relatively cool but not as cold as the meat shelf, preventing your greens from freezing.
 * Tip: Store leafy greens or delicate herbs in airtight containers or reusable bags on the 3rd shelf to keep them from wilting since they won't have the humidity control of the drawer.

### The 5-Layer Organization Guide
| Layer | Recommended Items | Why? |
|---|---|---|
| 1st (Top) | Leftovers, drinks, "grab-and-go" snacks, and ready-to-eat foods. | This is the warmest shelf with the most consistent temperature for pre-cooked foods. |
| 2nd (Upper Mid) | Yogurt, Cheeses, and Butter. | These are dairy products that don't spoil as easily as milk and benefit from the slightly more stable upper-mid temperatures. |
| 3rd (Lower Mid) | Milk and Eggs. | This is the middle-ground. Store milk at the back where it is coldest. Do not put milk or eggs in the door, as the temperature fluctuates every time you open it. |
| 4th (Bottom Shelf) | Vegetables & Fruits. | Often designed as a "crisper" drawer to hold humidity, which keeps produce from drying out. |
| 5th (Bottom) | Raw Meat, Poultry, and Fish. | This is the coldest part of the fridge. Keeping meat at the very bottom also prevents juices from leaking onto other foods (cross-contamination). |

### What about the Shelf Doors?
The doors are the warmest part of the fridge. You should only store items with natural preservatives here:
 * Condiments: Ketchup, mustard, mayo, and salad dressings.
 * Jars: Pickles, olives, and preserves.
 * Drinks: Water bottles, soda, or juices (but not milk!).

### Summary for your specific items:
 * Milk: 3rd layer (at the back).
 * Yogurt & Cheese: 2nd layer.
 * Eggs: 2nd or 3rd layer (in their original carton).
 * Extra Vegetables: 3rd layer.

You can definitely put veggies in the 2nd layer, but there is a specific reason why the 3rd layer is usually recommended over the 2nd layer for vegetables.
It all comes down to two things: Temperature and Humidity.

1. The Temperature Gradient
In most fridges, the air gets colder as you go down.
 * 1st and 2nd Layers: These are the warmest. While "warm" in a fridge is still cold, these shelves are best for things that are stable, like yogurt, cheese, or cooked leftovers.
 * 3rd Layer: This is the "sweet spot." It is colder than the top but not as cold as the meat shelf (5th layer). Most vegetables like it cool (around 34°F to 38°F) to stay crisp. If they are on the 2nd layer, they might stay a bit too warm, which causes them to go limp or rot faster.

2. The Humidity Factor
Vegetables love humidity. The 4th layer (the drawer) is designed to trap moisture. When you move to the open shelves:
 * The 3rd layer is closer to the vegetable drawer, so the air there tends to be slightly more humid.
 * The 2nd layer is closer to the top where the air is drier. Drier air makes carrots bendy and lettuce wilted very quickly.

### If you decide to use the 2nd layer:
If your 3rd layer is full of milk and eggs and you must use the 2nd layer for your overflow veggies, you just need to "help" them a little:
 * Wrap them up: Put the veggies in a sealed plastic bag or a container with a damp paper towel. This creates a "mini-fridge" environment for them so the dry air on the 2nd shelf doesn't suck out their moisture.
 * Avoid the back wall: On any shelf, try not to push vegetables against the very back wall, as that is where the cooling element is and they might actually freeze and turn to mush!

### Quick Recap of your Fridge:
 * 1st Layer: Your Mac & Cheese, Pizza Hut wings, and Beef Rolls (The "Eat Me Now" shelf).
 * 2nd Layer: Yogurt and Cheese.
 * 3rd Layer: Milk, Eggs, and Overflow Veggies (wrapped up).
 * 4th Layer: Main Vegetable drawer.
 * 5th Layer: Raw Meats.
