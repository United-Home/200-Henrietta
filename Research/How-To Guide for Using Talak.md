Application Instructions

	▪	Avoid spraying directly onto furniture or fabrics unless specified safe by product guidelines.
	◦	Outdoors:
	▪	Spray around the perimeter of buildings, focusing on foundations, doorways, windowsills, and other entry points.
	▪	Treat areas where pests are likely to congregate such as gardens, lawns, shrubs, and other vegetation.
	2.	How Long to Spray:
	◦	Apply a steady stream ensuring even coverage without over-saturating any area.
	3.	After Application:
	◦	Leave the treated area immediately after application is complete.
	◦	Allow treated areas to dry completely before re-entering:
	▪	Indoors typically requires about 2-4 hours drying time depending on ventilation and humidity levels.
	▪	Outdoors may require less time but ensure surfaces are dry before allowing pets or children back into treated areas.
Proper Storage When Finished
