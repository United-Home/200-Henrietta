### Milestone: Upgrade to Fiber Optic Ethernet Connections
#### Introduction
This milestone aims to upgrade the existing ethernet connections in the facility to fiber optics. The project involves the installation of new fiber optic cables in specific areas, including the back deck, the other side of the house, and potentially the attic. The upgrade is expected to enhance the network's speed, reliability, and overall performance, aligning with INSTAR Lab's commitment to leveraging advanced technology for efficient operations.
#### Tasks
1. **Assessment:** Conduct a thorough evaluation of the current ethernet setup and identify the areas that require an upgrade. This includes assessing the feasibility of installing a new ethernet connection in the attic.
2. **Planning:** Develop a detailed plan for the upgrade, including the layout of the new fiber optic cables and the necessary equipment and resources.
3. **Installation:** Carry out the installation of the fiber optic cables in the identified areas. This involves placing one ethernet connection in the ceilings of the back deck and another on the other side of the house.
4. **Testing:** Test the new connections to ensure they are functioning optimally. Identify and resolve any issues that may arise during this stage.
5. **Documentation:** Document the entire process, including the challenges encountered and how they were addressed, for future reference.
#### Acceptance Criteria
- All existing ethernet connections have been upgraded to fiber optics.
- New ethernet connections have been successfully installed in the ceilings of the back deck, the other side of the house, and, if feasible, the attic.
- The new connections have been tested and confirmed to be functioning optimally.
- A comprehensive report detailing the upgrade process, including any challenges and their resolutions, has been prepared.
