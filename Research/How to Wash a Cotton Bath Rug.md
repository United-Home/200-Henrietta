I'm sorry to hear that. Without the label, it might be difficult to know the exact washing instructions for your cotton bath rug. However, you can still try some general tips that work for most cotton rugs. Here are some suggestions:

- Use cold water and a mild liquid soap or rug shampoo. Hot water can cause shrinkage and fading, and harsh detergents can damage the fibers.
- Wash the rug with similar fabrics and colors, such as towels. This will prevent color bleeding and lint transfer.
- If the rug has a rubber or plastic backing, check for any cracks or peeling. If the backing is damaged, it might be better to replace the rug than to wash it, as it can clog your washer or damage your dryer.
- If the rug does not have a backing, or the backing is in good condition, you can wash it in a regular cycle with a low spin speed. You can also add a laundry disinfectant to kill any germs or bacteria.
- Dry the rug on a low or no-heat setting in the dryer, or hang it on a drying rack or clothesline to air-dry. Do not use high heat, as it can melt the backing or cause shrinkage.
