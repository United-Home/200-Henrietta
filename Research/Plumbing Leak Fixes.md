### Milestone: Infrastructure Repair and Safety Enhancement
### Introduction
This milestone focuses on addressing the critical infrastructure issues identified in our facility, specifically the leakages near the entrance of the back deck and the dryer area adjacent to the main electric panel box. The bathroom area on the top floor, equipped with a bathtub, shower, and toilet, is also included in this project. The primary goal is to ensure the safety and integrity of our infrastructure, eliminating potential hazards and improving the overall condition of our facility.
### Tasks

2. Develop a detailed repair plan, including the necessary materials, tools, and manpower required.
3. Execute the repair work, ensuring all safety protocols and standards are strictly adhered to.
4. Perform a thorough inspection and testing after the repair work to ensure the issues have been effectively addressed.
5. Document the entire process, including the assessment results, repair plan, and post-repair inspection results, for future reference and continuous improvement.

### Acceptance Criteria
The milestone will be considered complete when the following conditions are met:

- All identified leakages have been effectively repaired, with no signs of recurring issues during the post-repair inspection and testing.
- The areas around the main electric panel box and the bathroom facilities are safe and free from any potential hazards.
